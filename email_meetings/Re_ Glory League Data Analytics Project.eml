<div>Kia ora Gents,</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Firstly thank you for you time and energy today.&nbsp; It was a succes=
sful day for our students</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>To ensure transparency please see our below outcomes from today's meet=
ing:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Project Brief:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Glory League together with ABSL see the mutual benefits of working wit=
h the ABSL Innovators Team (placement students from MIT) consisting of Li Z=
hang (group leader), Franco Guerro, Karanveer Randhawa (Karan) and Reena Ch=
auhan.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The team are set to deliver 20 hours per week of placement hours.&nbsp=
; The format of the week involves two days of work in the ABSL office and t=
he third day offsite/home.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>During their time in office, ABSL will provide a Supervisor (Teena Eno=
ka) to oversee/support the team.&nbsp; Teena is not required to be in the o=
ffice with our team but can check in from time to time to ensure they are s=
afe, equipped and clear on their project
 direction.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Objectives:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>1)&nbsp; User performance - analyzing both &quot;In App&quot; and &quo=
t;on court&quot; behaviours and it's relation to eachother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</di=
v>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For example:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Does a leaderboard athlete use GL more than a non-leaderboard athlete?<=
br>
</li><li>Does a 14 year old use GL more than a 17 year old?</li></ul>
<div>2)&nbsp; Look at Stats across league and competitions to identify lead=
er stats against a STAR Standard/Rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>ABSL sets a range of standards for Assists, Passes, Lay Ups, Three Poin=
ters eg.&nbsp; Athletes receive a star if they are Bronze level or five sta=
rs if they are performing at Gold Standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>This could =
then assist with athlete development tracking and provide a great foundatio=
n to develop the GL Trainer Mode platform as a potential product.</li></ul>
<div>Form here, Glory League (Grant) will provide a Non-Disclosure Form to =
our students (and Lecturer and Supervisor) via email CC Tracy to complete a=
nd return prior to sharing of raw data owned by Glory League.</div>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>GL will pop into ABSL offices fortnightly to check in on our innovator=
s team and to provide mentoring and advice where required and where possibl=
e.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If the project flexes a little from the original scope, that is fine s=
o long as all parties are notified in advance.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Our team will keep a daily/weekly record of their deliverables and thi=
s is submitted to both the MIT lead lecturer and ABSL Supervisor each week =
for the purposes of meeting the course objectives.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>f you are happy with these terms, we will forward to our team for thei=
r understanding also.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>We thank you for your support and engagement on this awesome project a=
nd we look forward to working in collaboration moving forward.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Nga mihi,</div>
